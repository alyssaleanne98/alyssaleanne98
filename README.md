### Hi, I'm Alyssa ðŸ‘‹

I'm a scientist turned developer annd optimist. I am most passionate about bringing both the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. I have a B.S in Nutrition and food science from San Jose State University. I thrive the most when I am learning, exploring, and solving deceptively simple problems. Reach out and say hello!
