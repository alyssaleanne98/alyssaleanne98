### Hi, I'm Alyssa 👋🏽👩🏽‍💻
As a scientist-turned-developer and optimist, I am passionate about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. With a B.S. in Nutrition and Food Science from San Jose State University and two years of experience in the healthcare/pharmaceutical industry, I have honed my skills in problem-solving, learning, and exploration. I thrive when faced with deceptively simple problems that require creative thinking. If you're interested in connecting, feel free to reach out and say hello!
